output of ddcuitl environment:

Configuration suggestions:
   Issue:
      Group i2c does not exist.
   Suggestion:
      Create group i2c. To create group i2c, use command:
         sudo groupadd --system i2c
      Assign /dev/i2c-N devices to group i2c by adding a rule to /etc/udev/rules.d
      Add the current user to group i2c:
         sudo usermod -G i2c -a <username>
      After this, you will have to logout and login again.
      The changes to the user's group list are not read until a new login.

created group, don't know how to creat rule.

maybe now that gorup exists i should make install again and see if the installation creates the rule
